# Literature Pros and Cons Analyses

Every paper added to this repository must have a corresponding analysis in this folder.

The analysis must distinguish between:

- facts explicitly reported by the paper;
- engineering advantages and limitations supported by the paper's setup or results;
- uncertainties caused by missing enclosure, material, geometry, or sensor details.

Do not infer an enclosure material merely because a commercial sensor box is described as outdoor-rated.

## Required Workflow for New Literature

When adding a paper:

1. Add its citation to `paper/references.bib`.
2. Add it to `literature/literature_matrix.csv`.
3. Add verified sensor, material, geometry, and setup details to `literature/sensor_material_geometry_summary.md`.
4. Create a `ProConsList/<citation-key>.md` file using `TEMPLATE.md`.
5. Update the coverage table below.
